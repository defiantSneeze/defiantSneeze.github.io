This is a personal website, about me.

Here is the styling I've added to this webpage:

The font-family for the entire page has been changed to sans-serif,
because sans-serif is easy on the eyes.
Except for the h1 and h2 elements;
for those I imported a nice google font called 'New Tegomin'
by using link tags in the html document.

I've added a hero image from an external URL.  Nothing too fancy.

I've added a sticky nav bar with highlights.

Will create a footer with "Copyright (C) 2021 - Kayden Stevens"
which uses an html entity got the copyright symbol and the em-dash.

Hyperlinks will only be underlined when hovered upon.

I'm going to set a repeating background image.

I have styled the weekly schedule to highlight my courses.

I'm going to add a favicon
