This is a personal website, about me.

Here is the styling I've added to this webpage:

The font-family for the entire page has been changed to sans-serif,
because sans-serif is easy on the eyes.
Except for the h1 and h2 elements;
for those I imported a nice google font called 'New Tegomin'
by using link tags in the html document.
